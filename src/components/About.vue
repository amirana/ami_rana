                <p class="mb-6">Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Ami Rana, a dedicated front-end developer with a skiiled foundation in web development and a passion for creating exceptional user experiences. I recently completed (March 2023) my master's degree in UX Design from Kingston University in London, where I further refined my technical skills and embarked on a transformative journey into the world of UI/UX design.</p>
                <p class="mb-6">With <b>almost 3 years of industry experience</b>, I have had the privilege of working in diverse professional environments, from marketing firm to UI/UX design agency. These opportunities have allowed me to gain a deep understanding of front-end development, improving technologies such as <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks and libraries</b>. I take great pride in my ability to translate design concepts into elegant, responsive, and accessible user interfaces that leave a lasting impression on users.</p>
                <p class="mb-6">My journey into UI/UX design has enriched my skill set, allowing me to approach front-end development with a holistic perspective. By combining my technical expertise with my understanding of user-centered design principles, I will be able to deliver solutions that meet the unique needs and goals of both clients and end users.</p>
