                <p class="text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg leading-6 mb-4 md:mb-6 lg:mb-6">I recently completed (March 2023) my master's degree in UX Design from Kingston University London, where I further refined my technical skills and embarked on a transformative journey into the world of UI/UX design.</p>
                <p class="text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg leading-6 mb-4 md:mb-6 lg:mb-6">With <b>almost 3 years of industry experience</b>, I have had the privilege of working in diverse professional environments, from marketing firm to UI/UX design agency. These opportunities have allowed me to gain a deep understanding of front-end development, improving technologies such as <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks and libraries</b>. I take great pride in my ability to translate design concepts into elegant, responsive, and accessible user interfaces that leave a lasting impression on users.</p>
                <p class="text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg leading-6">Thank you for visiting my portfolio website! I invite you to explore <b><a href="#work">my work</a></b> and learn more about the projects I have had the privilege of contributing to.</p>
